# Source code for raearnold.com

[raearnold.com](http://raearnold.com) hosted via raearnold.github.io.

Using such fun things as:
- normalize.css
- Jekyll
- Font Awesome
- Google Fonts
- Sass
- Gulp (for CSSifying the sass, concatenating CSS, minifying CSS, autoprefixing CSS, etc…)
- … and other things, surely.

All for a single page website that plans to one day take over doing all the things [rachaelarnold.com](http://www.rachaelarnold.com) does (because who needs **two** name-based domains?).
